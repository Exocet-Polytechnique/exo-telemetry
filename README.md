# ExoTelemetry (formerly known as Exowatch)
This project contains the telemetry code running on an Arduino MKR NB 1500

The Arduino board will run a simple REST API server over LTE while updating its data over a serial connection with the main computer (a Raspberry Pi). The main computer's code can be found [here](https://github.com/Exocet-Polytechnique/ExoPIBrain)
